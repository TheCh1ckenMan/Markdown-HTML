## User Stories of Santorini ##

1. Cliff jumping at St Nicholas Church was fantastic, the fish restaurants have amazing produce straight from the sea
1. This place is absolutely amazing! This is the spot from where people take pictures of the famous Oia windmills, although many people know this and take advantage of this making it a very popular destination for tourists during sunset.

1. Best time to go here would be after dark. You'll have the place to yourself and get the gift of seeing the beauty of Santorini being bathed in ambient light!
